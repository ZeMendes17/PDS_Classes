Java Calendar Class Review

    This class has 2 Contructors, one without arguments and another one that receives
2 arguments, TimeZone zone and Local eLocale. Both are "protected" meaning that
they can only be used inside the class (cannot be accessed outside of this).
The First one creates a normal Calendar and the second one a Calender in a specific
time zone and locale. 
    Just like a Factory method, other methods are used to reach outside the class.
To create a new Calendar it is used the createCalendar method which prevents the user
from using the "new" operator, considered harmful.
    With this review, we concluded that this code uses a Factory Design Pattern.
