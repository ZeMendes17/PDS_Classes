1 - The Problem : Airport
When an aircraft is trying to land at the airport, how do we make sure that other aircrafts are not landing at the same time? Alert every aircraft and discuss priorities of landing with other aircrafts would be difficult, as well as communications between them.


2 - Solution 
Insert a mediator (Air traffic controller). This mediator will coordinate the landing of the aircrafts.
